# ERM (Electronic Register and Management)

This is a system that I made to help run family's business. With **Python**, **tkinter** for designing the UI and **gspread** to manage googlesheet that are used for this system as the base, I was able to build a system includes database to helps to keeps track of all the goods going out and in, sales report to keep track of the sales of each day with income, and a more seamless buying and selling process.

The first window contains search box in the middle-top to more easily search for items in the database, then the searched items will be shown in the middle box. We can double click the items that we wanted to add, to be then added to the lower checkout-box and its price added to the top-right number part. We can also change the quantity of purchased item in the checkout-box by double-clicking, then changing the qty of item by inputing the total of purchased item. To proceed to checkout, we can push [esc] on our keyboard which leads us to check out windows where we can input the received money, and get the change money.

The second window contain search box in the middle-top to more easily search for items in the database, then the searched items will be shown in the middle box. Before that, make sure you click on "Check Database" button to show the latest condition of items in our database. After that, you can "Add item", "Delete Item", "Change Item Info", etc.
